# Hackathon Project Submission

Hello,

I am **Ibrahim**, a student at the **Governor AI Program**. This is my submission for the hackathon project.

## Issue Encountered

While working on the project, I mistakenly used a **style guide** instead of the correct **Figma template**. Due to a misunderstanding, I didn't realize my error until after seeing the work of other students. I now realize that my project design does not fully align with the expected template.

## Request

I kindly request that you accept my submission despite this mistake. In Sha Allah, I will create and submit the **original template** as soon as possible.

## Conclusion

Thank you for your understanding and consideration. I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this hackathon and will ensure to correct the issue promptly.

**Your obedient servant,**  
Ibrahim
